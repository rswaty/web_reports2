## List of possible improvements to web reports

* add CRCS maps and materials
* add sclass descriptions
* add documents/data page with links to downloads
* consider blending with maps for context (instead of cropping)
* set up so all processing is done in one directory (if possible with git LFS) instead of doing GIS then web report
* consider rlandfire package
* add GitHub/Code buttons
* have scripts for each chart...functions?
* reduce number of BpSs in the disturbance chart


Wait to see what RIMC team says!
